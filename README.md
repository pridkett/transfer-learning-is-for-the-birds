Overview
--------

This repository provides some of the supplementary materials for my talk
"Transfer Learning is for the Birds", it's not yet 100% perfect, but it's a
good start. Principally, it consists of the following:

* A Google Colab notebook for training the models
* A set of three pre-trained TFLite models (unquantized, quantized, and Coral
  EdgeTPU optimized)
* A Python application to stream JPEG frames from a Raspberry Pi camera for
  real-time image detection with a Raspberry Pi.
